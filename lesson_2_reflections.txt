What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The directory becomes a git repository, which means you are able to track the 
history of each file contained therein.  That history is saved as metadata 
and is kept in the hidden .git file.  You must initialize a repository if you 
want to track different versions of your files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is just a temporary holding pen for files you've changed and
intend to commit.  Unlike a working directory, it is not a permanent home for 
the files, and you wouldn't be able to locate them on your hard drive.  And 
unlike a repository, the staging area doesn't hold metadata about tracked
files.  It only contains a the current state of the staged files.  It is 
valuable because it lets you stop and think about which files have changed, 
which files are related, and which ones should be included in a single
commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical 
change?

After placing your changed files into the staging area, you can run git diff 
--staged to see the changes from the most recent commit.  If there are too many
changes to be logically grouped together, you can remove files from the staging
area and add them to a separate commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized?  How would branches help?

If you want to experiment with new features or a dramatic change, branches would
be useful.  You'd be able to keep your master branch alive while adding new code 
to a different branch.  If the new idea didn't work out, no harm done.  If it 
does, you can merge the two branches.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Diagrams are useful because they allow you to see which commits are related
(i.e. parent and child) and which commits are reachable.  They also help you
see where branches have split from master and where they have been merged back
in.
