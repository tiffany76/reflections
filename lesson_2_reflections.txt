What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The directory becomes a git repository, which means you are able to track the 
history of each file contained therein.  That history is saved as metadata 
and is kept in the hidden .git file.  You must initialize a repository if you 
want to track different versions of your files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is just a temporary holding pen for files you've changed and
intend to commit.  Unlike a working directory, it is not a permanent home for 
the files, and you wouldn't be able to locate them on your hard drive.  And 
unlike a repository, the staging area doesn't hold metadata about tracked
files.  It only contains a the current state of the staged files.  It is 
valuable because it lets you stop and think about which files have changed, 
which files are related, and which ones should be included in a single
commit.
