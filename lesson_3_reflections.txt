When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you are working collaboratively with a team or if you work from different machines,
you would want to store the work in a remote repository so it remains reachable to
everyone who needs it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A collaborator may have made changes to the remote that would affect your own changes, 
in which case you would want to have control over when those changes are incorporated.
